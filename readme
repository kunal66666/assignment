# Kudosport Project Setup Guide

This project consists of a backend server and a frontend application. Follow these steps to get the project up and running locally.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js
- MongoDB
- React
- Git

## Backend Setup

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kunal66666/assignment.git
cd assign
```

2. Install backend dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the backend server:
```bash
node server.js
```

You should see the following messages in the console:
- "Server running on port 5000"
- "MongoDB Connected"

These messages indicate that your backend is successfully running and connected to the database.

## Frontend Setup

2. Navigate to the frontend directory:
```bash
cd kudsoport-frontend
```

```

The frontend application will be available at: http://localhost:5173/

## Verification
- Backend server should be running on port 5000
